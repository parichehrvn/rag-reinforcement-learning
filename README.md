# RAG-based Reinforcement Learning Q&A Assistant
A conversational **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that acts as an instructor for **Reinforcement Learning**.  
It maintains **conversation memory**, so you can ask follow-up questions naturally.
Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), [HuggingFace embeddings](https://huggingface.co/), [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
Deployed on [Streamlit Cloud](https://rag-reinforcement-learning.streamlit.app/) for interactive use.

## Features
- **Question Answering** over Reinforcement Learning Medium blogs and papers.
- **Conversational flow with memory**: context is preserved across turns.
- **Dynamic tool use**: the LLM dynamically decides whether to:
  - Use the **retrieval tool** (searching ChromaDB for relevant documents), or  
  - Answer directly from its own knowledge.
- **RAG pipeline**: retrieve relevant chunks from ChromaDB and generate responses.
- **Streaming UI**: assistant responses stream chunk-by-chunk in a chat interface.
- **Example questions** (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is Q-learning?‚Äù, ‚ÄúExplain policy gradients‚Äù) for quick start.
